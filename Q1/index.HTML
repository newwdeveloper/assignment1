                    Neeraj Chopra, a name that has become synonymous with Indian athletics, is not just a sportsman; he is a symbol of resilience, hard work, and the realization of dreams against all odds. Born on December 24, 1997, in Khandra, a small village in the Panipat district of Haryana, Neeraj’s journey from the fields of rural India to the grand arenas of global sports is nothing short of inspirational.
                    Growing up in a typical Haryanvi household, Neeraj was like any other village boy, full of energy and enthusiasm. However, his life took a turn when he was encouraged by his family to take up sports, initially as a way to manage his childhood obesity. The sport that caught his eye was javelin throw, an event that was not very popular in India at the time. This initial step into the world of sports was the beginning of a journey that would not only change Neeraj’s life but also bring unprecedented glory to Indian athletics.
                     tender age of 11, Neeraj was introduced to javelin throw by Jaiveer, a local athlete who saw potential in him. Recognizing his talent, Neeraj’s family supported him wholeheartedly, despite the challenges they faced. His training began under the guidance of Jaiveer, and later, under coach Naseem Ahmad at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) center in Panchkula.
